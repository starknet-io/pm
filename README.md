# StarkNet Project Management Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for project management related to the StarkNet protocol. Its primary function is to coordinate and document the StarkNet All Core Devs meetings, which are crucial for the ongoing development and improvement of StarkNet Ecosystem. Meeting agendas are tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/starknet-io/pm/issues) tab of this repository, allowing for transparent and collaborative planning. Additionally, a Google Calendar is available to track upcoming protocol meetings, ensuring all interested parties can stay informed about scheduled discussions.

## StarkNet All Core Devs Meetings Overview
### Purpose
StarkNet All Core Devs is a regular meeting held by the StarkNet development community to discuss technical issues and coordinate work on the StarkNet protocol. The meetings are attended by core contributors from various organizations. During the call, participants discuss potential protocol changes, testing and other related issues.The calls primarily focus on StarkNet client implementations, RPC specifications, networking layer, versioning, and more recently, consensus-related topics.

The calls are streamed and saved on the [StarkNet YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@starknet_foundation/playlists).

### Agendas
The agendas for calls are tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/starknet-io/pm/issues) tab of this repository. To add an item to an agenda, simply add a comment to one of the agenda issues.

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the StarkNet protocol at a low-level. This means StarkNet applications are generally not allowed as topics, unless their mention relates to protocol changes.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The core developer meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussions. [Starknet Forum](https://community.starknet.io/) is a better venue for such discussions.

### Who Can Attend
Protocol developers, client developers, researchers and [SNIP](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs) authors are encouraged to attend the meetings. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance, please reach out to [Aayush Giri](mailto:aayush@nethermind.io) or [Leo](mailto:leo@starkware.co).

### Who Manages the Meetings
The StarkNet All Core Devs meetings are facilitated by the StarkNet community, with support from the StarkNet Foundation (SNF). The meetings are broadcast on SNF channels, reflecting the collaborative nature of the StarkNet ecosystem.
